# What this game is about
I have implemented an image classifier using k-nearest neighbors algorithm. You have to land the helicopter on the platform. The pilot of this helicopter is unconscious, so you need to give the passenger instructions. Using WASDE you can teach the passenger specific movements to guide him to the platform.

# Installation

After you downloaded the files go to the folder and run 'npm install' to install the packages. After that you can open 'index.html' in your browser. I have tested it on Google Chrome, that should work.

# Requirements

- Webcam

# Demo
You can see the running demo on https://grunkhead.github.io/prog8/, this might be taken offline in the future.

# Saving the trained model
You can save the model by pressing the key '/', after that there will be a prompt to save the file locally on your computer. You can load this xxxx.json model inside the code where knn.load(xxxx) is.
